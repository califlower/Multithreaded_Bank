- Bugs currently we need to fix/check for:

  - Timing (Takes to long to run things) - BUG 
  - Try testing for a lot of threads open, even going above 20, see what happens.
  - Allow for Full Name bank accounts (currently only allows for one word, A full bank first and last name would be ideal)
  - *not really a bug but i think its a good idea to have* 
    - Add a total amount option to see the balance in the bank account (rather than waiting 20 seconds).
  
  .. nothing else yet, will look

- Bugs currently we need to fix/check for:

  - Timing (Takes to long to run things) - BUG 
  - Try testing for a lot of threads open, even going above 20, see what happens.
  - Allow for Full Name bank accounts (currently only allows for one word, A full bank first and last name would be ideal)
  - **When closing server, clients should stop running as well**
  
  .. nothing else yet, will look

- Bugs currently we need to fix/check for:

 IMPORTANT:
  - **When closing server, clients should stop running as well**
  - ** Need to complete the finish function, when finish is typed, the current bank account should close
  and the program should prompt the user as if the client was just opened again **
  - **Timing - 2 second thing**
    - Try testing for a lot of threads open, even going above 20, see what happens.

  NOT VERY IMPORTANT:
  - Allow for Full Name bank accounts (currently only allows for one word, A full bank first and last name would be ideal)
  .. nothing else yet, will look

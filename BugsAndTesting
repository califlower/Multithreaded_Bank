- Bugs currently we need to fix/check for:

 IMPORTANT:
  - Try testing for a lot of threads open, even going above 20, see what happens.
  - Allow for Full Name bank accounts (currently only allows for one word, A full bank first and last name would be ideal)
  - Currently we allow strings longer than 100 characters, this is NOT allowed!!
  - Need to fix balance thing (easy fix)
  - Need to add finish/exit in the print statement.
